HMS is an application aimed at automating the management of hospital operations,
including patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, and billing.
The system is expected to facilitate efficient management of hospital resources, enhance
patient care, and streamline administrative processes.

# Additional features added
1. Drug Allergy Check
   - Ensure a Doctor does not prescribe a drug that a Patient is allergic to

2. Password Validation Check
   - This feature prompts all users in the system, including patients and staff, to re-enter the new password for validation before the password change is confirmed.
   - In addition, the system does not allow the new password to be set to the default password, which is “password”.

3. Error Handling - Invalid Inputs
   - This feature ensures that Patient enters valid input for Date of Birth (DD/MM/YYYY), Contact Number (8-digit number), Email address (example@domain.com).
   - This feature ensures that Doctor enters valid Date and Time format for appointments in DD/MM/YYYY and HH:mm format respectively.
